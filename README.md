# Dear Reviewer
- Check out `./notes/adr.md`: mini architecture decision record
- And `./notes/tests.md`: captures test cases I'd have loved to cover, but ran out of time for
- I spent about an hour reviewing the AC & planning out the initial design, maybe slightly more
- implementation & docs were done async, didn't track the time there, but easily over 3 hours.
  - lots of the time was spent trying to figure out how I wanted to structure my code, given that I opted to go for patterns new to me
  - unfortunately didn't get to writing tests as I've run out of time. I did plan out basic test cases though
