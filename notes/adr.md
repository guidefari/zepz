- decided to use `users/route.ts` so I can keep the FE & BE layer separate. that file can be deployed in any node env, making it reusable in an env with web, & native mobile
- exploring local first dev workflow, using repository pattern to persist to indexedDb
- to keep data fresh, I'm going with a network first approach, as opposed to cache first. If the network request fails, that's when we go for previously loaded data that was saved to indexedDb.
- I went with mobx to get a simple object for UI state. Prefer this approach to dogmatic react, it's easy to read, and framework agnostic
  - Also easily extensible
- the acceptance criteria alluded to a tabular format for presentation, I purposely decided against that and went for friendlier presentationðŸ˜„
